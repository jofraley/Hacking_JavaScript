# Hacking JavaScript for Solution Engineers 

A place to learn how to build geo apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

## Welcome

This repository contains short labs that step you through the process of developing a web application with ArcGIS API for JavaScript. 


## Resources

Here are the resources you will use for the labs.

* [ArcGIS for Developers - Account, Documentation, Samples, Apps, Downloads](http://developers.arcgis.com)
* [Esri Open Source Projects - More source code](http://esri.github.io)
* [JS Bin - Interactive JS coding](http://jsbin.com)
* [A simple guide for setting up a local web server (optional)](https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89)
* [Help with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](http://w3schools.com)

## Labs

The labs start from ground-zero and work through the accessing different aspects of the API and how to begin to build an application and add functionality.
